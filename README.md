# Agri-Energy Connect

Agri-Energy Connect is an ASP.NET MVC web application that bridges the gap between *farmers* and *employees* in the agri-energy industry. It enables efficient management of agricultural products by allowing 
different roles to perform dedicated tasks such as product addition, filtering, and account management.
